I was asked to build a software for national community centers Employees management.
General Description
The company divided to 3 districts, North, Center and South. Every District has a district manager, deputy and secretary. every district has a local community center for each city.
every local community center has a Manager, Secretary and Center Employees. each employee can work in just a single community center.
Every center has a career advancement and personal development department. people who are interested to get advise service helping develop their career can apply to the community center and ask for it. The career advancement department can only service up to 30 customers (open applications) A person can apply to work in the community center. The system will save all Employees data and all applications will be in data structure (Arraylist on any other you choose) . Every department has their own variables that work with their own functions. There’s a button to save all the Arrays data in a txt file.
Software requirements
1.	A comfortable interface to enter the data.
2.	Connections between the interface to the data structure chosen.
3.	Will have to use inheritance and not repeating similar details, use polymorphism when needed.
4.	Recommended to use “Interface” classes
5.	Need to apply all getters and setters methods.
6.	Need to take care of Exceptions if needed.
7.	Divide the code to functions.
8.	Need to add documentation in the code explaining the functions.
9.	Need to use meaningful variable names for the departments and functions.
10.	Need to pay attention to the connections between the departments
